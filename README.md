# Dynamic User Profile Page

## Overview
Build a single-page application that allows users to view and edit their profile information. The application will fetch user data from a mock API, display it, and allow for in-place editing. Form validation will be implemented using JavaScript, and the UI will be dynamically updated without full page reloads.
